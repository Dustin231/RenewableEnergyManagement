### Code files discription:
Renewable Energy management and Demand Response and by PSO Algorithm (matlab code) 

The codes contain an optimal economic dispatch of a grid connected microgrid. The microgrid consists of solar photovoltaic, diesel and wind power resources. An incentice based demand response program is incorporated into the operation of this mcirogrid.

There have been claims by some students regarding not working of codes even with high speed computers. So, please keep in mind, it is mostly for being familiar with these kind of problems coding. I hope I can receive feedback from you about the code.
